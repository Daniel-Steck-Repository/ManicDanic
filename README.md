- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Daniel Steck
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Analytics and Data Science, given that I love math and programing and want to keep improving.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL, Python, and R. Though I am relearning SQL and learning python and R to keep my skills up.

- I am currently working on cleaning up my code before posting it here so I apologize for the lack of code at the moment.
